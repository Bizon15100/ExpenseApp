# ExpenseApp
Expense application. 
I decided to use Builder design pattern to create every expense. Contains various of methods to filter your expenses with needed conditions. 
It has the function of saving data in Json or CSV format. Program will recognize the format using the given file name and its extension.

To use this app you have to build Maven project in Intelij and run main class ExpenseCliApp.java.
